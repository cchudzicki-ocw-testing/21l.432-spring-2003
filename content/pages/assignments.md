Writing Requirements
--------------------

Students may fulfill these requirements by choosing one of the options listed below. Graduate students and seniors majoring in Literature, Comparative Media Studies or Science, Technology and Society must choose option three. Each option requires that papers be submitted in Class #8 and Class #20.

Students may revise and resubmit the two essays to improve the grade within one week of the date on which the essays are returned. Only the grade on the revision will count toward the final grade in the course.

Option 1: A Course Journal
--------------------------

Keep a journal summarizing the leading arguments and ideas in each week's class. Illustrate general notions with concrete examples drawn from class discussions, your readings, your own experience of television. Submit installments of your journal as typed papers due on the dates listed above.

Option 2: Two Short Problems
----------------------------

Write an essay of 4-7 double-spaced typed pages on two of the topics listed below. Do not choose more than one question that asks you to summarize the writings of others.

*   Read chapter four of Raymond Williams, _Television: Technology and Cultural Form_. Then define his idea of "flow" in television and evaluate its persuasiveness. Is American television a good test for his theory? How do technologies such as cable television, remote channel-switchers, video-recorders affect Williams' notions concerning our experience of television? Is television the only medium in which vastly dissimilar messages jostle against one another? What assumptions about the viewer are implicit in the concept of "flow"?
*   Summarize Gerbner's argument about the effect of television violence on viewers. Then summarize Horace Newcomb's response "Assessing the Violence Profile..." \[available by request\]. Which perspective would you defend and why?
*   Analyze a single episode of a contemporary situation comedy, emphasizing its visual style, its treatment of character, its strategies of comedy. Speculate briefly concerning its place in the line of TV comedy.
*   Summarize Fiske and Hartley's chapter on "Bardic Television" and discuss the possible value of this perspective for understanding American television. Be sure to give specific examples of TV programming to support your argument.
*   Examine the script of a TV series and write an essay analyzing the writer's contribution to the episode. How much of the camera's behavior is controlled by the script? Does the script exploit qualities that belong to particular performers or that have been established in previous episodes? How does the script adapt to the special conditions of television broadcasting? Available scripts include a range of episodes from MTM Productions, QM Productions, a few shows of the 1980s and beyond including _Seinfeld._
*   Summarize James Carey's "A Cultural Approach to Communication" and specify some of the ways in which this perspective applies to American television.
*   Describe and evaluate an episode from a TV crime series. What are the principal themes of the episode? What are its chief formulas for plot and characterization? Try to identify themes, techniques and structural features that have been shaped by the TV medium. Be sure to discuss the "political" assumptions - notions about order, authority, social institutions - that are embedded in the episode. Recommended reading: Fiske and Hartley's chapter, "A Policeman's Lot"; Todd Gitlin, "Prime Time Ideology..." in Newcomb; Thorburn, "... TV Acting..." and "TV Melodrama."
*   Write a succinct account of the laws and regulations that helped to shape the Broadcast Era, drawing on class discussions, Barnouw's chronology of important dates, encyclopedia entries on networks, cable television, the FCC, the Dumont Network; and relevant material from Hilmes, _Hollywood and Broadcasting_; Anderson, _Hollywood TV_; Boddy, _Fifties Television_; Streeter, _Selling the Air_.
*   Write an analysis of two or three dramas from the era of live television, giving special emphasis to the visual aspects of each. Recommended reading: Barnouw on "the golden age" of television, Michael Kerbel, "The Golden Age of TV Drama" in Newcomb, third edition.
*   Analyze _Amos 'n Andy_ as a cultural document. What range of stereotypes is exploited in the program? What attitudes toward American life and toward racial differences are assumed in the text? What does the text perceive as the material of comedy? Recommended reading: Ely, _The Adventures of_ _Amos 'n Andy_; MacDonald, _Blacks and White TV_.
*   Discuss the evolution of a significant secondary character in a television series of the 1970s or later. Some suggestions: Radar or Hotlips on _MASH_; Buddy on _Family_; Mary Ellen on _The Waltons_; Gloria on _All in the Family_; any of the prime figures in _Friends_, the children on _The Cosby Show_, George or Elaine on _Seinfeld_, any recurring character in _Once and Again_, Tony's mother or son or daughter in _The Sopranos_.
*   Commercials are often said to be television's subtlest art form. Choose two or three families of commercials - beer commercials, for instance; telephone commercials; commercials for cars or washday products; commercials for high-tech items such as computers or Web-related services - and analyze them as forms of drama, giving particular attention to the assumptions about American life inscribed in their plots and characters.
*   Drawing on readings and on class discussions concerning television as a carrier of cultural ideologies, write an essay about the theme of technology in science fiction or in medical shows. Possible texts: _Medic, Marcus Welby, The Bold Ones, Medical Center, Medical Story, St. Elsewhere, ER; Star Trek_ and its successors_, The Twilight Zone, The Prisoner, Babylon 5, The X-Files._
*   Compare British versus American forms of television, centering on a single genre: crime series, science fiction, situation comedy.

Choose one or two such programs and discuss the cultural and aesthetic significance of their hybrid natures.
*   Write an essay about _The Sopranos_ in relation to the film and TV traditions out of which it comes. Is it a gangster story? A family melodrama? How does this series exploit the medium of television?

A Note About Plagiarism
-----------------------

Plagiarism -- use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement -- is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work.

If you borrow another person’s phrasing, that material must be enclosed in quotation marks. If you use ideas conceived by others but reformulate them in your own prose, then you must acknowledge your collaboration in one of two ways: explicit acknowledgment in the body of your text ("As Lionel Trilling argues in his introduction to _Pride and Prejudice_,...") or in a footnote fully citing your source.

For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution consult the style guides available in the Writing and Communication Center and the [MIT Website on plagiarism](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/).

Guidelines for Formatting and Citation
--------------------------------------

There are many accepted formats for citations and footnotes. I prefer the following simple principles.

Italicize (or underline) titles of books, plays or feature films; use quotation marks to indicate titles of poems, stories or articles. Novellas or long stories that have been published in individual bindings are italicized as if they were full-length texts. So: Conrad's short story "Youth" is placed in quotation marks as is Yeats' poem "The Second Coming," but _Heart of Darkness_ (a novella), _Lord Jim_ (a novel), and _Modern Times_ (a feature film) are italicized.

Use **parenthetic citations** instead of footnotes wherever possible. For instance, in citing quoted passages from the primary text under discussion, the first reference should include full title, place and date of publication, and a page citation; thereafter, only the page citation is necessary. E.g.: (_Heart of Darkness_, London, 1898, p. 6). In the next citation: (p. 8). Note that the period concluding the sentence goes outside the parenthesis citing the page number(s).

An alternative to this practice: **the first reference** to the text can be footnoted, which note can include the remark "Subsequent parenthetic references are to this edition."

If you cite secondary works in footnotes, use the following format: David Thorburn, _Conrad's Romanticism_ (New Haven, 1974), p. 17. Note that publisher is not required.

**Most Important:** Do not repeat information unnecessarily. For example, if your text reads "As David Thorburn suggests,.....," then the footnote should not repeat the author's name; if you also mention the book title in your text, then the footnote should include only the place and date of publication and the page number.

**Formatting Quotations:** When quoting material, integrate the quoted passage into the body of your own text using quotation marks if the passage is not longer than four lines. If the passage is longer than four lines, indent an extra five spaces left and right, forgo the quotation marks, and use single spacing.

Use an **ellipsis** (three spaced dots) to indicate omitted material. If the omission begins after a complete sentence, retain the original period and **then introduce the ellipsis.**

Use square brackets \[ \] to indicate your additions or changes in the original material.

Examples below.

### Quoted Passage Integrated into your Text

_The Shadow Line_ repeatedly dramatizes scenes of tense conversation and even verbal coercion between the young protagonist and a series of older figures. As David Thorburn writes, "Though all his people are orphans, Conrad remains one of the great portrayers of the anguished impotence of fatherhood. One of his defining subjects is maturity's useless generosity toward the young."¹

### Extended Quotation, Separated by Indentation from your Text

George Eliot's power to create and sustain an intimate communion with her readers, her sad stringent awareness of how society shapes and constrains us, her respect for the ordinary heroism of daily life, her moral wisdom and generosity--all this is crystallized in the final paragraphs of her greatest novel:

Certainly those determining acts of... \[Dorothea's\] life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it....  
Her finely-touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were not widely visible. Her full nature... spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.²
